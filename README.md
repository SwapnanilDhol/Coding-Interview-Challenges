# Coding Interview Challenges

This repo contains coding interview questions written in languages that I am most comfortable with such as C++, Python3, C, and Swift.
This repo is 100% inspired by [Rudrank Riyam](https://github.com/rudrankriyam)'s exceptional resource of Leetcode solutions written in Swift.
The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/rudrankriyam/LeetCode-in-Swift)

## What's the purpose of this repository?

I'm currently in my Sophomore year (about to enter my Junior year) in university pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and I've started to prepare for my Internship interviews with the hopes of landing an Internship with one of the big tech companies. This repo is just a place where I put up my solutions for reference purposes and so I thought it might be nice to make it a place where everyone can refer to. 

## About Me

As I've mentioned above I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in CSE. Apart from that, I won the [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc) and the [Layers](https://layers.is/) Scholarship in 2019. I make iOS apps with my recent app being Neon: Capture, Edit, Share. It's a gorgeous color and gradient picker app that you can find [here](https://tiny.cc/neontheapp)
