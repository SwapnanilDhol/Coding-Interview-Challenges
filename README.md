# Coding Interview Challenges

This repo contains coding interview questions written in languages that I am most comfortable with such as C++, Python3, and Swift.
This repo is 100% inspired by [Rudrank Riyam](https://github.com/rudrankriyam)'s exceptional resource of Leetcode solutions written in Swift.
The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/rudrankriyam/LeetCode-in-Swift)

## What's the purpose of this repository?

I'm currently in my Sophomore year (about to enter my Junior year) in university pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and I've started to prepare for my Internship interviews with the hopes of landing an Internship with one of the big tech companies. This repo is just a place where I put up my solutions for reference purposes and so I thought it might be nice to make it a place which everyone can refer to.

## About Me

Hello! I am Swapnanil Dhol: A CS&E Junior in India, WWDC 2019 Scholar, WWDC 2020 Swift Student Challenge Winner. I am also a GSoC 2020 student working with VLC (VideoLAN) on their iOS project making the app more modern with a codebase rewrite, removal of third party, old, not maintained dependencies and integrating new features over my 3 month summer contract.
I also have a strong passion to teach and share knowledge and try to organize coding camps as often as I can. I also upload Swift and SwiftUI tutorials on my [Youtube](https://youtube.com/tnqvd) channel where I explain in detail and clarity about the various aspects of the language and use that information to build clean apps.

You can learn more about me over on my website at [Swapnanil Dhol](https://swapnanildhol.github.io).
